"# Art-Plaza-Project" 

(Sorry for no audio in the video, microphone wasn’t working when I was screen recording. This is a basic summary of everything I discussed in the presentation).


For my project I decided to name it Art Plaza, it’s a simple version of instagram and amazon specifically geared towards art, where you can share and buy art pieces from other people.

When you search up the website it will take you to the login screen, if you don’t have an account you can create another one it has basic validations (every input is required), it also has a toggle button for the password. 

Registering takes you to the create profile page, it has basic validations as well, the only required input is username. It has a simple file upload button for profile pic which doesn’t work right now so if you click the submit button an alert pops up. But if you click create it will redirect to the home screen

You can go to your profile page in the upper left corner which would normally display the profile pic you submitted.

Can edit your profile, it has the same validations as the create page, and file upload again has a pop up alert. It will redirect to the home screen

Home page already have a post created during trial run which would display the post image (still have to find a way to print image data from database onto page), can view the post by clicking on the name, shows the post creator, description, if you are the post creator it will display an edit and delete button on right.

View post shows all the info from the home page, the photo would be bigger. It would include a price and purchase button (if you aren’t the creator) which is where purchasing art comes in. If you are the creator it will instead have an edit button. Posts also include likes. Clicking the ‘like’ will redirect to home, and if you view the post the total likes would have increased. If clicked twice by the same user there is a validation which will show that you already liked the post. The ‘unlike’ button unlikes the post and the total likes will decrease by one.

The plus button in the bottom corner of the home page redirects to the create post page, everything except the image, in this case, is required. So if we create and view this post it will show the edit button instead of the purchase button. 

Now when viewing home screen it will show edit button, which redirects to the edit post page. Clicking the edit button in the post also redirects to the edit post page.

If you are viewing someone else’s post pressing the purchase button will show an alert that your purchase has been received. It will redirect to purchases page, which would show all your purchases. If the post was previously purchased a validation will redirect to home and alert that
